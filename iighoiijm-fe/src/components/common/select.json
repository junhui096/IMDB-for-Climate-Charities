Over the years, the Houston Zoo, Miller Outdoor Theatre, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, the Houston Garden Center, and the Hermann Park Golf Course have all added to the Park's importance as a recreational destination. In the last ten years, under a partnership with the City of Houston, HPC and the city have spent over $40 million to enhance and restore Hermann Park.",

Our strategy is to hold governments accountable for fully implementing and enforcing clean water laws and regulations and for improving legislative and regulatory protections where appropriate. Our vision is that the Chesapeake Bay and its tributary rivers will again be highly productive and in good health as measured by water quality standards.",
